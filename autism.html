      Autism is a disorder that disables nerves and  effects parts of the brain.  This disorder is not a disease but it can develop over time, mostly after things like car accident.  Autism is a very serious disorder so here are two most common changes<br/>
 </p>
    <ol style="font-size:30px">
  <li>Changes in emotions internally</li>
  <li>Changes in behavior physically</li>
      </ol>
    <p style="font-size:30px">
      Commonally if these changes occur the person or being must be tested for their Autistic disorder, the reason they have to be tested is because there are millions of different Autistic disorders in the world and they have to know which one the person or being has so the doctor or hospital can help treat them or help them with the Autistic disorder.  
      There is no issue if you, a loved one or if someone you know has a Autistic disorder, you just have to let a doctor or medical being know so they can help.
    Autism can impact or effect a life of one and the ones around them.  The way a Autistic disorder impacts the person or being, is by changing the way the person or being thinks or see things, also there physically behavior here are some examples of how Autism or a Autistic disorder can affect a person or being.<br/>
