       Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or unease that is strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities.
Certain signs of anxiety include often shortness of breath, constant worry, fear, or confusion. These symptoms are severe and upsetting enough to make individuals feel extremely uncomfortable, out of control, and helpless. 
   Anxiety disorders fall into a set of separate diagnoses, depending upon the symptoms and severity of the anxiety the person experiences.
Anxiety can occur for any reason and no reason at all. Anxiety often comes without warning and may not be something you can expect or control. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment. Severe cases of Anxiety could cause Depression and sometimes suicide.  <br/>
